# DigitalCommunicationsSimulations-2019
This project was completed under the requirements of the course 'Digital Communications II', 
taught in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at AUTH. 
The first task was to use the enclosed code (owner: Prof. Christos Dimakis) and run the simulations. 
The next step was to research the necessary terms and understand the simulations in depth. 
Finally, the results were explained thoroughly, providing insight in the function of the systems simulated.
